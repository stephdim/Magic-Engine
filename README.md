# Magic-Engine

This project is on conception phase

Purpose :

Magic-Engine is an engine based on Unity which is used to build VR application.
It will generate code at runtime that you can use to build your own application.

Currently, I'm trying to generate code, compile it and add the script to an object at runtime to see what's possible.
